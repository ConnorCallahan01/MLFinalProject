    "  >With the recent CPI numbers coming out and a recession on the loom, we wanted to identify what conditions cause inflation before the inflation happens. We think that this topic is especially pertinent at the current moment. We want to identify the features/conditions under which inflation happens and try to predict if there will be inflation to the money supply. \n",
